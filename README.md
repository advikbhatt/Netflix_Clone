A preview may appear, so you can ignore it and visit the site because of the security feature on the web browser you are on.
Since this is a clone website it is considered to be a phishing website for any fraud or scams 

Chrome has built-in safety features to protect you while you browse â€” like Google Safe Browsing, which recently found phishing on the site you're trying to visit. Phishing sites pretend to be other sites to trick you.

You can only visit "this unsafe site" if you understand the risks.
